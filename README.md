# Pipeline2AzureWorkItems

Pipeline2AzureWorkItems project allows you to take the results from Veracode Pipeline Scan and create them as Work Items into Azure DevOps.

This is an initial approach and must be intended like that: It only reads the .json file from Pipeline Scan and creates Work Items without validate if there are previos flaws that have been closed, remediated or something like that...it would be a very interesting future work!!

Let me say that this project is based on the parsing of .json file created by Jason Phillips on https://github.com/jphillips-vc/pipeline2detailedreport 

<b>USAGE: python Pipeline2AzureWorkItems.py [-o Organization Name in Azure] [-p Project Name in Azure] [-t task] [-token $(System.AccessToken)] [-f filename.json] [-bid $(Build.BuildId)]</b>

-o is the Organization Name in Azure where you will create the work items

-p is the Project Name in Azure (belonging to Organization Name) where you will create the work items

-t is Azure DevOps Work item type. It is necessary to be sure that your Azure Project is created supporting the specified Work Item Type. Default type is task

-token is the System Token generated by Azure to execute the pipeline. It allows to use Azure API Services to create Work Items

-f .json filename with Veracode pipeline Scan results

-bid BuildId to create work itmes with information that allows you to identify the related build

<b>STEPS</b>

- Place Pipeline2AzureWorkItems.py file in your pipeline output folder where your results.json file resides.

- After Pipeline Scan execution, executes Pipeline2AzureWorkItems.py with specific parameters

- You will see new Work Items in the project's Boards section, in Azure DevOps
